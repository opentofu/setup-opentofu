# We currently do not have any specific code owners
# In the future, we will have a Github team of global code owners of the entire package
# Later on, we will start splitting up the responsibilities, and packages will be assigned more specific code owners

# The last matching pattern takes the most precedence for CODEOWNERS. CODEOWNERS does not have fine-grained control so we will
# just match whole changes for these specific files, but @diofeher is responsible for taking care of the Dependabot updates 
# in this repository.
